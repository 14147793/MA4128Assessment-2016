Forecasting is about predicting or estimating future trends or events forecasting is useful 
in a number of settings for example in business and in scientific research. A common forecast in business might be an 
economist trying to estimate future GDP or gross domestic product which is a country's national income. Another common application of forecasting in business is when financial analysts in investment banks try to forecast the movement of stock prices or commodity prices or derivative prices so the banks traders and clients can make money from these movements. the ability to forecast economic or financial movements is for obvious reasons not easy but can be extremely profitable if done correctly. It is important not to make mistakes when forecasting as even the smallest of differences between the forecast and reality could end up costing a firm large sums of money. Another form of forecasting is forecasting the demand for the firms products once again it is very important to get this right as the firm may well be basing production on these forecasts and therefore there costs will be based on the forecast. An incorrect forecast of demand for its products could cost a manufacturing company a significant amount of money. There are different types of forecasting. Some is based on quantitative  methods and others are based on qualitative methods. An example of qualitative forecasting is market research based on the opinions of consumers. Quantitative forecasting is the other type of forecasting that people engage in. Quantitative methods of forecasting use past data to forecast the future.  There are a number of different methods that are included in the quantitative methods these include the average method where predictions of the future are based on an average value of the past. Another method is the seasonal naive approach this method takes account of seasonal changes.
